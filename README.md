# Review Bar

Replaces Steam's text review ratings with a bar that shows the percentage of positive and negative reviews.

The plugin works on Steam Store app pages, search results, and wishlist entries when Steam provides review percentage data. It reads information already present in the page and does not make separate API requests. It runs as a WebKit preload, so it does not need a Lua backend.

## Build and install

Requirements: [Millennium](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

From this repository's root:

```sh
bun install
bun run build
```

Starlight builds the plugin using the checked-in `millennium.toml`. Enable **Review Bar** in Millennium's plugin settings and restart Steam if needed.

## If it stops matching

Steam's store-page class names (`.user_reviews_summary_row` and `data-tooltip-html`) have been stable for a long time, but Valve can change them without notice. If the bar does not appear:

1. Open a store page in Steam.
2. Use Millennium's remote debugger or devtools access to inspect the DOM around the review score.
3. Update `ROW_SELECTOR` and the regular expressions in `parseScore()` in `webview/preload.ts` to match Steam's current markup.

## Customizing the look

The colors are CSS variables set at the top of `injectStyles()` in `webview/preload.ts`: `--reviewbar-positive` and `--reviewbar-negative`. Change their hex values to customize the colors. Bar width, height, and label format are defined nearby.

## Scope and limitations

- Works on Steam Store app pages, search results, and wishlist entries where review percentage metadata is available.
- Does not change the Library interface.
- Does not fetch review data from Steam's API. It uses information already present in the page.
- Steam may change its page structure or tooltip markup, which could require updates to the selectors.
